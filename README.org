#+TITLE:  README for app

* Developers
** iOS / XCode
   Opening in XCode, use xcworkspace, otherwise you'll get build errors regarding missing frameworks.

** Migrations
*** New Migrations

	There's is a tool in the repository to create a new repository and can be run like so:

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
	tools/mkm.sh title_of_migration
    #+END_SRC

	Where `title_of_migration` is a short description of the
	change. After running that there will be a new migration file and
	the index.js will be updated to include that migration in future
	runs.

	Some caveats:

	1) The class name in the generated migration will use the
       title_of_migration casing and should be updated to reflect our
       naming convention. I hope to fix this eventually.
	2) If the app is running under the debugger then after running
	   that command the app will reload and run your blank/new
       migration, so be careful of that. I'm still trying to think of
       a good solution to this.
